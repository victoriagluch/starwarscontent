<p>In late 2014, Star Wars lovers around the world rejoiced at the release of the official trailer for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMOVFvcNfvE">Episode VII: The Force Awakens</a>. Science enthusiasts were also eager to see what science fiction technologies would make an appearance in the latest installment of the famous saga.</p>
</p>Is the idea of flying a Death Star through deep space or wielding a lightsaber strictly science fiction? Would developing Star Wars technologies actually require breaking any laws of physics? Surprisingly, the answer is often no.</p>

<h3>Gamma-ray bursts</h3>
<p>What about a Death Star, a moon-sized weapon with laser cannons that incinerate entire planets? It might surprise you to learn that there is no physical limit on how much energy could be delivered by a beam of light, such as those emitted by a ray gun, a lightsaber, or a Death Star. In fact, extremely high-energy beams of radiation already exist in nature!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.universetoday.com/118140/are-gamma-ray-bursts-dangerous/" class="link">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)</a> are large flashes of high-energy radiation in deep space. They produce enough energy to incinerate nearby planets and can send deadly radiation to ones further away. But don’t worry, the closest GRBs have only been observed in <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/112194/possible-gamma-ray-burst-detected-in-andromeda-would-be-closest-ever-observed/" class="link">galaxies very far from Earth</a> (over 8,000 light years away), and there is a very low chance of one happening closer to home. Still, there is evidence that the energy from <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-21082617" class="link">a GRB reached Earth around the year 775</a>.</p>
<h3>Physics of the Impossible</h3>
<p>In his book <em>Physics of the Impossible</em>, <a href="http://mkaku.org/home/" class="link">Michio Kaku</a> explains how understanding physics and the laws that govern the universe makes it possible to predict which science fiction technologies are most likely to become reality. He classifies technologies generally considered “impossible” intro three categories:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle; line-height:200%;">
  <li>Technologies that theoretically follow the known laws of physics</li>
  <li>Technologies that are at the threshold of scientists’ current understanding of the laws of physics</li>
  <li>Technologies that violate the known laws of physics</li>
  </ul>
 <p>Many of the technologies featured in Star Wars—including deflector shields, blasters, and interstellar travel at the speed of light—actually fit in the first category. They do not defy the known laws of physics and could actually become reality in the decades to come, perhaps even in your lifetime!</p>
<p>For example, in the book Kaku explains how a <a href="http://www.explorecuriocity.org/Content.aspx?contentid=1872" class="link">real-life lightsaber</a> could plausibly be built using a hollow telescoping tube that fills with hot plasma when activated. Not only does hot plasma glow like a lightsaber, it would also be hot enough to melt most solids.</p>
<h3>Powerful lasers</h3>
<p>Some of the most powerful lasers ever developed are capable of producing up to one petawatt (one quadrillion or 10<sup>15</sup> watts) of power. That’s still far from the planet-destroying power GRBs. Also, the <a href="http://texaspetawatt.ph.utexas.edu/overview.php" class="link">petawatt laser’s</a> high rate of energy transfer is only possible because it releases light in short pulses that last no more than a few femtoseconds (10<sup>-15 </sup> or one quadrillionth of a second).</p>
<p>But don’t give up hope of being a space super-villain just yet! Many different <a href="http://www.explorecuriocity.org/Content.aspx?contentid=825" class="link">kinds of lasers</a> have been developed and scientists are constantly working on better ones. For example, many of the materials used in lasers crack under high energy conditions. To solve this problem, the scientists who built the petawatt laser used a strong combination of glass mixed with neodymium as their gain medium. That’s the area inside the laser where energy builds up. However, to build a laser as powerful as a GRB, researchers would first have to discover a gain medium that remains stable under conditions much more extreme than those inside the petawatt laser.</p>
